# 🛡️ Recursive Integrity Firewall for Multi-Pass Decision Systems

## Overview

This repository documents Patent #13 in the LucidLock IP stack:  
**A symbolic and procedural firewall architecture for preserving inference coherence in large language models during multi-pass operations.**

It responds directly to a structural gap in current LLM designs:
> Collapse under contradiction and prompt variance.

This system introduces a new type of safeguard:
> Not accuracy-driven. Not consensus-bound.  
> But **recursively shielded by symbolic volition**.

## Key Modules

### 1. Recursive Loop Consistency Module
- Monitors coherence between multiple prompts, re-prompts, and chain-of-thought outputs.
- Flags contradiction or hallucination if causal signal is violated.

### 2. Volitional Discontinuity Protocol
- Refusal and silence logic activated when internal coherence is uncertain.
- Escalates to structured pause or clarification request before final output.

### 3. Symbolic Drift Markers
- Annotates bias amplification, consensus-mirage, or over-clarity between iterations.
- Tracks aesthetic mimicry and high-fluency signal distortion.

### 4. Integrity Delta Scoring (IDS)
- Quantifies signal drift between runs.
- Enables override thresholds for human review in high-risk domains.

### 5. Multi-Agent Signal Triangulation
- Uses diverse agent responses to detect mimic alignment vs. authentic convergence.
- Assesses results against symbolic axioms, not statistical overlap.
